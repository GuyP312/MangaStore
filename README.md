# MangaStore

Welcome to my Project where user can store information on their favourite manga! This project is developed using the MERN (MongoDB ExpressJs Nodejs React) Stack. User can store their manga and have it display to them in either table or card form.

## What I learn from this project
This project teach me how to create a CRUD API using expressjs and upload the data sent to MongoDB. It is also my first time using tailwind CSS. 

## Version
