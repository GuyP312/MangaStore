# MangaStore (V2)

Welcome to my Project where user can store information on their favourite manga! This project is developed using the MERN (MongoDB ExpressJs Nodejs React) Stack. User can store their manga and have it display to them in either table or card form.

## What I learn from this project
This project teach me how to create a CRUD API using expressjs and upload the data sent to MongoDB. It is also my first time using tailwind CSS. 

## Version
### V1
The user can store the manga's name, author and publish year. The user can create, edit and delete the manga. The user is able to view the manga store by viewing it either by a table format or a card format.

### V2
Added more input option for when user want to store manga. This include star rating, description and a picture where user can upload image from their device. Add another button on the card format where user can see an alternative way to see information for that manga.
